# Weather App

[Live preview](https://sarav929.github.io/weather-app/)

This weather app was created as part of The Odin Project utilizing the [Visual Crossing API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api). The primary goal was to practice API integration and gain hands-on experience with promises and callbacks. Users can search for a city, with error handling to ensure input is required and to display a message if the location is invalid. The next page shows current weather conditions along with a 7 day forecast with weather icons for better visualization.

- Built using Webpack and Babel.
- Async/await syntax for fetching data from the API.
- Followed best practices by separating application logic from DOM manipulation.
- Added responsiveness for smaller screens using media queries.
