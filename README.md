# Weather App - The Odin Project

[Live preview](https://sarav929.github.io/weather-app/)

This Weather App was created as part of The Odin Project and integrates the Visual Crossing API to fetch real-time weather data. The main goal of the project was to practice API integration and gain hands-on experience with promises, callbacks, and async/await syntax.

### Features:
- City Search: Users can search for a city, and the app displays the current weather and a 7-day forecast.
- Error Handling: The app ensures valid user input, displaying an error message if the location is invalid or missing.
- Current Weather and 7-Day Forecast: Displays real-time weather data along with a 7-day forecast, using weather icons for better visualization of weather conditions.
- Temperature Unit Toggle: Users can toggle between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) to view temperatures in their preferred unit.

### Technologies:
- Built with Webpack and Babel to bundle the code.
- Async/Await syntax is used for fetching data from the Visual Crossing API.
- Separation of Concerns: Application logic is kept separate from DOM manipulation for better code structure and maintainability.
- Responsive Design: The app is made responsive using media queries, ensuring a smooth experience on smaller screens.
